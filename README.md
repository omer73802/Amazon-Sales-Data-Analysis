# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Amazon sales transaction data in order to identify key revenue drivers, evaluate seller and category performance, and assess the business impact of discount strategies.

---

## Key Business Questions
- What are the overall sales KPIs (total revenue, average order value, and order volume)?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- How do sellers differ in terms of revenue and average order value?
- Do higher discount levels lead to increased sales performance?

---

## Data Source
- Amazon Sales Dataset containing 100,000 transaction records, including orders, sellers, categories, pricing, discounts, and payment details.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – initial exploration and pivot table analysis  
- **SQL (Microsoft Access)** – data aggregation, validation, and analytical queries  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard and data visualization

## Key Insights & Conclusions

### Seller Performance
Seller-level analysis reveals two distinct sales patterns:
- Some sellers generate high total revenue through large transaction volumes despite lower average order values.
- Other sellers achieve higher average order values but generate lower total revenue due to fewer orders.
This highlights the importance of balancing transaction volume and order value to maximize revenue.

### Category Performance
Category-level analysis shows relatively uniform average order values and total revenue across product categories.  
This suggests that category alone is not a strong differentiator of purchasing behavior in this dataset, and revenue differences are primarily driven by order volume rather than transaction value.

### Discount Impact
Discount analysis reveals a clear negative relationship between discount size and average order value.
Higher discounts are associated with lower average transaction values and do not lead to increased total revenue, indicating that aggressive discounting is not an effective sales growth strategy in this dataset.
