# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data in order to
identify top-performing product categories, sales trends over time, and
key revenue drivers.

## Key Questions
- What are the total and average sales?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- Which seller gained higher profit on average?
- Do different discounts amounts effects the sales?
  
## Data Sources
-Amazon Sales Dataset

## Dataset Conclusions
-Seller-level analysis reveals two distinct sales patterns: some sellers achieve high average order values with relatively low total revenue, while others generate higher total revenue through larger transaction volumes despite lower average order values

-Category-level analysis indicates relatively uniform average order values and total revenue across categories, suggesting that category alone is not a strong differentiator of purchasing behavior in this dataset

-Discount analysis reveals a clear negative relationship between discount size and average order value. Higher discounts are associated with lower average transaction values and do not lead to increased total revenue, suggesting that aggressive discounting is not an effective sales growth strategy in this dataset

-Seller-level analysis revealed distinct sales strategies across sellers. While some sellers generate high total revenue through large transaction volumes, others achieve higher average order values with fewer orders. This highlights the importance of balancing sales volume and transaction value
